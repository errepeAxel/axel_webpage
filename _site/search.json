    "text": "Work in progress\n\n\n\nThis site is stll under development, so you may notice that some parts are not fully polished yet. Thanks for your patience and feel free to check back soon for updates!\n\n\n\n1 What is this notebook about?\nSpatial transcriptomics is a powerful way to study how cells are organized and interact within tissues. One of the most popular Python libraries for this kind of analysis is Squidpy(see the original paper here). Squidpy comes with many tools for exploring and visualizing spatial omics data.\nIn this guide, we’ll focus on one of its key features: neighborhood enrichment analysis. This method helps us see which cell types are more likely to be close to each other, revealing interesting patterns and possible cell–cell interactions in tissue.\nWhen I first tried Squidpy, I found neighborhood enrichment a bit confusing to interpret. I found it challenging to interpret the output and connect it to biological meaning. This motivated me to write this short guide, where I try to digest what is being done under the hood and how to interpret the results.\nI hope you find it useful, and please feel free to share any suggestions or questions in the comments!\n\n\n2 Download the data\nFollowing the Squidpy tutorial on analysis of Xenium data, we will be using a Xenium dataset of Human Lung Cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to download this dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how you can grab the data yourself:\n\nGo to the dataset’s preview page.\n\nUnder Output and supplemental files, download the Xenium Output Bundle (we’ll use the full dataset).\n\nUnzip the downloaded file.\nInside the unziped folder, unzip all the .zip files to get everything ready for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load libraries\nimport spatialdata as sd\nfrom spatialdata_io import xenium\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport scanpy as sc\nimport squidpy as sq\n\n/home/axel/miniconda3/envs/ne_analysis/lib/python3.12/site-packages/dask/dataframe/__init__.py:31: FutureWarning: The legacy Dask DataFrame implementation is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
