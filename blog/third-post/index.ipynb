    "Spatial transcriptomics is a powerful way to study how cells are organized and interact within tissues. One of the most popular Python libraries for this kind of analysis is [Squidpy](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)(see the original paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01358-2)).   Squidpy comes with many tools for exploring and visualizing spatial omics data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we’ll focus on one of its key features: *neighborhood enrichment analysis*. This method helps us see which cell types are more likely to be close to each other, revealing interesting patterns and possible cell–cell interactions in tissue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When I first tried Squidpy, I found neighborhood enrichment a bit confusing to interpret. I found it challenging to interpret the output and connect it to \n",
    "biological meaning. This motivated me to write this short guide, where I try to digest what is being done under the hood and how to interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you find it useful, and please feel free to share any suggestions or questions in the comments!"
